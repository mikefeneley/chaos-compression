# chaos-compression

This is a placeholder repo. No significant work has been done on this project yet.

<b>Roadmap</b>

Create a multipurpose compression/decompression tool similar to tar for fun. Support a variety of compression formats. Provide a GUI wrapper for the tool or to an existing compression tool like tar with support for more compression formats.
